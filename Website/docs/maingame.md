## How to craft
In order to craft new blocks and tools, the player will have to be in range of the crafting table and then right click on the crafting table block. One should then drag the blocks from the inventory into the crafting table. If the blocks are positioned in the correct position to craft an item, the question mark will display the item you are able to create. To create the item and add it to your inventory, click on 'craft' which will now be green.
If the blocks are not positioned in an arrangement which corresponds to any craftable item or the player does not have enough blocks, then 'craft' will remain white and the question mark will still be displayed.
