It aims to incorporate as many dynamics as possible from the base 3D Minecraft game into a 2D version coded entirely in Python. In this version of Minecraft, one can break blocks, place blocks, craft new items using the crafting table and craft the end-game item. Instuctions below detail how one can install the 2D Minecraft game. In addition to the base interactive game, one can also install a gym agent which plays the game by itself! Gym is a Python library which provides a standard API for developing reinforcement learning algorithms. The team used gym to create an agent which takes actions in the minecraft environemnt, receives rewards for the actions it takes and the states it enters and checks to see whether the game has been completed. One is able to create custom tasks which the agent will have to complete and receive a reward thereafter. In addition, you are able to make use of any of the built in tasks that the team has created for you.

When you click here, details on the controls of the game will appear. Clicking on begin game allows you to be moved into the playable game. Please see the screenshots below for a visual guide. Demo of the game screens Instructions for playing How to craft In order to craft new blocks and tools, the player will have to be in range of the crafting table and then right click on the crafting table block. One should then drag the blocks from the inventory into the crafting table. If the blocks are positioned in the correct position to craft an item, the question mark will display the item you are able to create. To create the item and add it to your inventory, click on 'craft' which will now be green. If the blocks are not positioned in an arrangement which corresponds to any craftable item or the player does not have enough blocks, then 'craft' will remain white and the question mark will still be displayed.
